Cryptocurrency Trading has large potential rewards, but also large potential risk. You must be aware of the risks and be willing to accept them in order to invest in Cryptocurrency . Don't trade with money you can't afford to lose. This is neither a solicitation nor an offer to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency . No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those discussed on this app or on any reports. The past performance of any trading system, methodology, strategy, or results is not necessarily indicative of future results.

It should not be considered legal or financial advice. You should consult with an attorney or other professional to determine what may be best for your individual needs.

Dipper - Crypto Signals provides trading algorithms based on a computerized system. All advice is impersonal and not tailored to any specific individual's unique situation. Dipper - Crypto Signals, and its principles, are not required to register with the NFA as a CTA and are publicly claiming this exemption. Information posted online or distributed through this app has NOT been reviewed by any government agencies this includes but is not limited to signals, back-tested reports, statements and any other marketing materials. Carefully consider this prior to purchasing any Cryptocurrency based on our signals. For more information on the exemption we are claiming, please visit the NFA website: http://www.nfa.futures.org/nfa-registration/cta/index.html. If you are in need of professional advice unique to your situation, please consult with a licensed broker/CTA.

DISCLAIMER: Cryptocurrency Trading has large potential rewards, but also large potential risk. You must be aware of the risks and be willing to accept them in order to invest in Cryptocurrency . Don't trade with money you can't afford to lose. This is neither a solicitation nor an offer to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency .

Dipper - Crypto Signals does not make any guarantee or other promise as to any results that may be obtained from using our content. No one should make any investment decision without first consulting his or her own financial advisor and conducting his or her own research and due diligence. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Dipper - Crypto Signals disclaims any and all liability in the event any information, commentary, analysis, opinions, advice and/or recommendations prove to be inaccurate, incomplete or unreliable, or result in any investment or other losses.

Unless otherwise noted, all returns posted on this site and in our videos is considered Hypothetical Performance. HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENTLIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.



THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.

With the exception of the statements posted from live accounts on Tradestation and/or Gain Capital, all results, graphs and claims made on this website and in any video blogs and/or newsletter emails are from the result of back-testing our algorithms during the dates indicated. These results are not from live accounts trading our algorithms. They are from hypothetical accounts which have limitations (see CFTC RULE 4.14 below and Hypothetical performance disclaimer above). Actual results do vary given that simulated results could under or over compensate the impact of certain market factors. Furthermore, our algorithms use back-testing to generate trade lists and reports which does have the benefit of hind-sight. While back-tested results might have spectacular returns, once slippage, commission and licensing fees are taken into account, actual returns will vary. Posted maximum draw downs are measured on a closing month to closing month basis. Furthermore, they are based on back-tested data (refer to limitations of back-testing below). Actual draw downs could exceed these levels when traded on live accounts.

CFTC RULE 4.41 - Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not been executed, the results may have under or over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown.

Statements posted from our actual customers trading the algorithms (algos) include slippage and commission. Statements posted are not fully audited or verified and should be considered as customer testimonials. Individual results do vary. They are real statements from real people trading our algorithms on auto-pilot and as far as we know, do NOT include any discretionary trades. Tradelists posted on this site also include slippage and commission.

This strictly is for demonstration/educational purposes. Dipper - Crypto Signals does not make buy, sell or hold recommendations. Unique experiences and past performances do not guarantee future results. You should speak with your CTA or financial representative, broker dealer, or financial analyst to ensure that the software/strategy that you utilize is suitable for your investment profile before trading in a live brokerage account. All advice and/or suggestions given here are intended for running automated software in simulation mode only. Trading futures is not for everyone and does carry a high level of risk. Dipper - Crypto Signals, nor any of its principles, is NOT registered as an investment advisor. All advice given is impersonal and not tailored to any specific individual.</p>
